# credit-risk-classification

In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

Low-risk/healthy accounts still have a 100% precesion in the model which I believe is still based on the volume of healthy accounts in the data sample. In this model, the high-risk accounts have a lower precision of 87% but a recall of 100%. I don't think the sample size contains enough data on high-risk accounts but the classification report shows that the model has excellent performance, with high precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes. It is achieving a high level of accuracy, especially for low-risk loans.
